# Predict Flight Delays 
'DS 303: Introduction To Machine Learning' 
Course Assignment

The data set 'FlightDelays.csv' was given.

I performed the following steps :
1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Data Visualisation was done to see the various coorelations of features and ststus of flight(delayed or not) and to explore the dataset and understand the underlying trends
2. Preprocessing the dataset: to remove null values, generate dummy variables, scaling the data and divide the dataset into 60% train and 40% test
3. Prepare a logistic model and training on the data set: I made use of scikit-learn Logistic Regression Model
4. Interpret the model and coefficients: At this step, detailed analysis was done to understand which attributes are important for the prediction and what attributes if any, are causing over-fitting
5. Processing the feature vector: Selection of the Important attributes 
6. Training Logistic regression Model on the new featutre vector
7. Comparing the performance for Step 3 and Step 6

I acheived an accuracy of 91.37% on the test data
